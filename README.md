## Installation

- gd-plug

  Install directly from Godot Asset Library

  or

  Download this repository, move `addons` to your `{project_dir}`

- git

  Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

  > git must be set to environment variable

- [gd-plug-ui](https://github.com/imjp94/gd-plug-ui)(optional)

  User interface for gd-plug, not required when working with commandline

## Getting Started

1. Create `plug.gd` at your project root, as below:

```gdscript
extends "res://addons/gd-plug/plug.gd"

func _plugging():
    # Declare your plugins in here with plug(src, args)
    pass
```

> [!TIP]
> Or run `init` command: `godot --headless -s addons/gd-plug/plug.gd init`

2. Declare plugins in `plug.gd` under `_plugging()`, for example:

```gdscript
extends "res://addons/gd-plug/plug.gd"

func _plugging():
    # Declare your plugins in here with plug(src, args)
    # By default, only "addons/" directory will be installed
    # Proudly made by me too!
    plug("imjp94/UIDesignTool")
    plug("imjp94/gd-YAFSM")

    # Tools
    plug("fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration")
    plug("EricEzaM/godot-color-palette")

    # Unit test
    plug("bitwes/Gut")

    # By Zylann
    plug("Zylann/godot_scatter_plugin")
    plug("Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin")
```

3. Finally, run `install` command in shell

```shell
# --headless is optional to disable godot window
godot --headless -s plug.gd install 
```

## Post Update Hook

Post update hook can be connected in 3 ways:

- Declare in plug() argument
  - `plug(src, {"on_updated": "post_update"})`
- Connect to `update` signal
  - `connect("updated", self, "post_update")`
- Overwriting `_on_updated` function
  - `func _on_updated(plugin)`

Post update hook always returned with one argument - dictionary that store information about the plugin

```gdscript
func post_update(plugin):
    print("%s updated" % plugin.name)
```

## Version Control

What can be ignored from version control system?

- `/.plugged`: Plugins' git repo are cloned to this directory
- `/addons`: Based on preference, but now dependencies can be safely ignored since it will be managed by gd-plug

What should be added to version control system?

- `plug.gd`: Dependency config file
- `addons/gd-plug/plug.gd`: gd-plug's core

## More Examples

For most of the case, a plugin can be "plugged" without any extra configuration, as by default gd-plug will extract whatever located in plugin's `/addons` directory and install to current project's `/addons` directory.

However, some plugin's repository may be structured differently, thus, different configuration needed.

- Addon files are not located in `/addons` directory, for example, [Master-J/DecalCo](https://github.com/Master-J/DecalCo)
  - Explicitly include the directory to install:

    `plug("Master-J/DecalCo", {"include": ["decalco/"]})`
- Repository contains only addons files, for example, [HungryProton/scatter](https://github.com/HungryProton/scatter/tree/v3)
  - Change `install_root` to destination directory and include all files:
    `plug("HungryProton/scatter", {"install_root": "addons/scatter", "include": ["."]})`

```gdscript
extends "res://addons/gd-plug/plug.gd"

func _plugging():
    # Declare your plugins in here with plug(src, args)
    # By default, only "addons/" directory will be installed
    # Version freeze
    plug("imjp94/UIDesignTool", {"branch": "demo"}) # Always pull update from "demo" branch
    plug("imjp94/gd-YAFSM", {"tag": "1.0.0-stable"}) # Freeze to stable version
    plug("imjp94/gd-plug", {"commit": "7a642f90d3fb88976dd913051de994e58e838d1a"}) # Must be full length 40 digits commit-hash

    # Dev plugins, can be excluded or uninstalled with "production" command
    plug("fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration", {"dev": true})
    plug("EricEzaM/godot-color-palette", {"dev": true})

    # Post update hook
    plug("bitwes/Gut", {"on_updated": "_on_GUT_updated"})

    # It works even if the files are not located in "addons/"
    plug("Master-J/DecalCo", {"include": ["decalco/"]})

    # Repo that contains only addon files
    plug("HungryProton/scatter", {"install_root": "addons/scatter", "include": ["."]})

    # Source other than github
    plug("https://gitlab.com/Xecestel/sound-manager") # Gitlab
    plug("file:///D/Godot/local-project/.git") # Local git repo

    connect("updated", "_on_plugin_updated")

func _on_updated(plugin):
    # Override to catch all updated plugins
    match plugin.name:
        "imjp94/gd-plug":
          print("Use upgrade command!")

func _on_GUT_updated(plugin):
    print("%s updated" % plugin.name)
    print("Installed files: " + plugin.dest_files)

func _on_plugin_updated(plugin):
    # Catch all updated plugins with signal
    print("%s post update hook with signal" % plugin.name)
```

## Known Limitations

- Godot always show errors from plugin repositories in `./plugged` even with `.gdignore` (See [#32](https://github.com/imjp94/gd-plug/issues/32))
- Sometimes random .import files will be unable to remove, while the reason behind it still remains unknown.
  - Workaround: Read output for those .import files that failed to remove, and manually delete them.
- `autoload` script references in project setting are not cleared as plugin uninstalled.
  - Workaround: Manually remove `autoload` scripts from project setting
- Binary files in used by Godot can't be removed by gd-plug, when plugin uninstalled with editor opened. For example, [Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin)'s GDNative binaries.
  - Workaround: Quit editor, then execute `clean` command or manually remove plugin folder from `/.plugged`
